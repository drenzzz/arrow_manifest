# ArrowOS (EXPERIMENTAL BRANCH)

 Getting Started
---------------
**NOTE: THIS BRANCH IS EXPERIMENTAL, use arrow-13.1 branch for buildable source.**
To get started with the ArrowOS sources, you'll need to get
familiar with [Git and Repo](https://source.android.com/setup/build/downloading).

To initialize your local repository, use command:

```bash
repo init -u https://github.com/ArrowOS-T/android_manifest.git -b arrow-13.1_ext
```

Then sync up:

```bash
repo sync
```

Add-Ons
-------------------
Before building the system, add this prop to your device system.prop.

```bash
# Hardware Description
ro.device.chipset=your_chipset
ro.device.display_resolution=your_display_spec
ro.device.colorbody_phone=your_phone_colors
```

Building the System

 Initialize the ROM environment with the envsetup.sh script.

```bash
. build/envsetup.sh
```

Lunch your device after cloning all device sources if needed.

```bash
lunch arrow_devicecodename-buildtype
```

Start compilation

```bash
